## About

This is my emacs setup, which I use in my every day workflow. It is continuously being tweaked and updated as I refine the way I work.

I use `evil-mode`, which provides vim-like keybindings. I have started to extend this with `key-chord-mode`, with the view of getting to a place where the majority of my key bindings will be two or three short keystrokes - not the _key-combiniation hell_ that emacs provides out of the box :).
