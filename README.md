## About

This is my emacs setup, which I use in my every day workflow. It is continuously being tweaked and updated as I refine the way I work.

I have started to use `key-chord-mode` to try shorted the amount of keystrokes needed for my most used commands. For example: `gs` mapped to `magit-status'`.
